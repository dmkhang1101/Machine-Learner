This folder contains the code to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm that is tested via the Iris dataset, achieving accuracy over 0.95 on classifying types of Iris based on parts' measurements. The algorithim utilizes Euclidian Distance as distance measure. 
Instructions: navigate to knn.py and run the file, graph of accuracy against varied k values will be displayed.
