This folder contains the code to implement the Random Forest Algorithm with Stratified Cross Validation Technique using Information Gain as splitting criteria. The code is tested on 3 datasets: wine.csv, to predict certain types of wine based on content; house_votes_84.csv, to predict whether a US Congressperson is Democrat or Replucian based on their responses to varied policies; and cancer.csv, to diagnose breast cancer based on cell's measurements. The algorithm achieves accuracy, recall, precision and f1 score over 0.95 for all datasets.
